 We have finished to set up a full node in the Waves Blockchain, this node has the objective of managing requests to the Waves API, and allows the interoperability between platforms. This technology use Lease Proof Of Stake (LPOS) algorithm for the consensus resolution, which implies that the nodes with more Waves token, accumulates in HODL as a lease, will have more weight for the generation of the blocks, and therefore will receive a greater reward.  We are inviting our clients and enthusiastic investors from the blockchain world to participate in the mining benefits of our node.
